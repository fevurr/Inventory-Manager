# Inventory-Manager

I ONLY MADE THIS PUBLIC BECAUSE I NEEDED TO DO SO TO CONTINUE ON THIS.  YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND USE IF YOU WANT BUT I HAVE NOT REPACKAGED SO THE APPLICATION IS NOT CURRENT AND WILL NOT WORK FOR OTHER USERS PROPERLY, THE CODE IS CURRENT THOUGH.  YOU WILL HAVE TO REPACKAGE YOURSELF.

This is a very simple CRUD style inventory system so my coworkers and I can log our IT assets and keep track of them much better.  This application utilizes Google Firebase as a database.  In order to use this application as it is you will need to create a database through that and download your firebase adminsdk file and replace the original file in the "firebase_keys" file to link to your database.  After that you will only need to replace the cred path to the old file with your new one.
